The hosted page brings everything together: an embedded Power BI dashboard, live API integration, download options, and clear documentation — all built using HTML, JavaScript, and Power BI.

## 📁 What’s Included

- **Power BI Dashboard** (`Demo Sales Dashboard.pbix`):  
  Visual report built with mock sales data, showing KPIs, product trends, and spatial insights by Australian states.

- **Mock Dataset** (`Sales_data.csv`):  
  Simulated sales data used to generate the Power BI dashboard.

- **Web Integration** (`index.html`):  
  A self-contained HTML page that embeds the Power BI dashboard and provides contextual explanation and downloadable assets.

- **API Demonstration** (`fetch-api-demo.js`):  
  JavaScript script that fetches live product data from [FakeStoreAPI](https://fakestoreapi.com) and displays it on the webpage using the `fetch()` method.
